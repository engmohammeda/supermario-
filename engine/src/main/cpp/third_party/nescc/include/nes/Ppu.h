/**
 * The 2C02 picture processing unit -- timing and register file only.
 *
 * This does not draw anything yet. What it does provide is the part every NES
 * program depends on before a single pixel matters: a dot/scanline counter
 * running at three dots per CPU cycle, the vblank flag appearing and clearing
 * at the right moments, and the NMI that drives a game's main loop.
 *
 * NTSC frame geometry: 262 scanlines of 341 dots each.
 *
 *   0-239    visible
 *   240      post-render, idle
 *   241      vblank starts at dot 1; NMI fires here if enabled
 *   242-260  vblank continues
 *   261      pre-render; vblank, sprite-0 and overflow clear at dot 1
 *
 * The register-file behaviour is real, not stubbed: the shared write toggle
 * used by $2005/$2006, the buffered read on $2007, the VRAM auto-increment and
 * the nametable/palette mirroring all work, because game code misbehaves in
 * confusing ways when they do not.

/**
 * The 2A03's audio processing unit.
 *
 * Five channels mixed into one mono signal: two pulses, a triangle, a noise
 * generator and a delta-modulation channel that plays sampled audio straight
 * out of cartridge ROM.
 *
 * Everything is driven by a divider hanging off the CPU clock, so this is
 * ticked with CPU cycles and nothing else. Two clock rates matter:
 *
 *   - The channel timers run at half the CPU rate (the triangle at the full
 *     rate, which is why it can reach frequencies the pulses cannot).
 *   - The frame counter divides down to roughly 240 Hz and issues the
 *     "quarter frame" and "half frame" pulses that clock envelopes, sweeps and
 *     length counters. It has nothing to do with a video frame, despite the
 *     name, and in its four-step mode it also raises an IRQ.
 *
 * The mixer is deliberately nonlinear. The hardware sums its channels through
 * a resistor ladder, so a channel gets quieter as the others get louder; the
 * usual polynomial approximations of that curve are used here. A linear sum
 * sounds noticeably wrong -- brittle and too loud with everything playing.
 *
 * Output is accumulated into a buffer at one sample per CPU cycle and
 * decimated by the caller, which is the simplest thing that does not alias
 * audibly at NES frequencies.

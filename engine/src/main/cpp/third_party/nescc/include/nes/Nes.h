 * a Memory object, which an NES does not have -- the reset vector comes from
 * the cartridge via the bus. Driving Processor directly is both simpler and the
 * shape a multi-chip system wants, since the master clock has to advance the
 * PPU and APU alongside the CPU rather than letting the CPU pace itself.
 *
 * The clock is a free-running default_clock: the CPU runs flat out and reports
 * cycles, and pacing (once there is video to pace against) belongs one level up.

/**
 * The CPU address bus of an NES.
 *
 * Overrides emu6502's Bus to decode the 16-bit space into the console's four
 * regions. The base class's Memory pointer is unused -- every access is routed
 * here instead.
 *
 *   $0000-$1FFF  2 KB internal RAM, mirrored every $0800
 *   $2000-$3FFF  8 PPU registers, mirrored every 8 bytes
 *   $4000-$401F  APU and I/O registers
 *   $4020-$FFFF  cartridge, via the mapper
 *
 * Every region is live: PPU registers, the APU, OAM DMA at $4014 and both
 * controller ports.
 *
 * $4017 is the one address whose meaning depends on direction. Reading it is
 * controller port two; writing it is the APU's frame counter. They are
 * unrelated registers that happen to share a pin.
 *
 * This is also where time passes. Every access the CPU makes while executing an
 * instruction first advances the PPU and APU by one CPU cycle, so a device is
 * sampled at the cycle its access happens rather than at the instruction
 * boundary before it. That is the only place in the machine positioned to know
 * when an access occurs -- the CPU reports cycles after the fact, in one lump.

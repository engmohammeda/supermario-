// Saving and restoring the whole machine.
//
// The one design decision worth explaining: every class describes its state
// *once*, in a single serialize() that runs in both directions. A save routine
// and a separate load routine drift apart -- somebody adds a field to one and
// not the other, and the bug surfaces days later as a game that resumes almost
// correctly. With one description there is nothing to keep in step.
//
// The format is not portable and does not pretend to be. It is a dump of this
// build's state, guarded by a version and by the size of every structure it
// writes, so a state from a different build is refused rather than misread. If
// it ever needs to travel between builds, that is a different job with a
// different cost, and the guards are what will make the refusal loud.
